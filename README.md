# Simple GraphQL Server Example
### Based on 'GraphQL Course for Beginners' course by NetNinja (freeCodeCamp.org)

Example Apollo GraphQL queries include:
- GamesQuery: pulls info about all games
- GameQuery: based on an $id, pulls info about a specific game
- AuthorQuery & ReviewQuery: based on an $id, pulls info about a specific author or review, with nested details
- AddMutation, EditMutation & DeleteMutation: demonstrate basic CRUD operations based for a single object
